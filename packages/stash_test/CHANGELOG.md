## 4.5.3

 - **FIX**: Reading nested JSON throws TypeError issue [#45](https://github.com/ivoleitao/stash/issues/45). ([e93ff90e](https://github.com/ivoleitao/stash/commit/e93ff90ed0f849779b58c3baa4d34973608ce7ab))

## 4.5.2

 - **FIX**: in the scope of https://github.com/ivoleitao/stash/issues/43 operations on a cache or vault should not imply reading the full entry from the backing store when supported, or if they do the deserialization should not happen as only the info objects needs to be retrieved. This change had a number of consequences namely removing the support for getting the (Cache/Vault)Entry from some events: CacheEntryEvictedEvent, CacheEntryExpiredEvent, (Cache/Vault)RemovedEvent, (Cache/Vault)UpdatedEvent. A fix was also made on sqlite_stash where the getInfo was not working correctly. This is part 1 of the fix, the backing stores should stop obtaining the Entry when asked to obtain the info.
